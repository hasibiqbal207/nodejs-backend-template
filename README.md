# nodejs-backend-template
A boilerplate project designed to kick-start Node.js applications with a structured setup. 

# Node.js Boilerplate

This is a simple Node.js boilerplate with Express, dotenv, ESLint, Prettier, and Mocha for testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nodejs-boilerplate

Running the Tests
npm test

Linting and Formatting
npm run lint
npm run format


compression
cookie-parser
cors
cron
helmet
joi
lodash
morgan
nodemon
ulid
winston
http-errors
validator

compression: Middleware that compresses response bodies for all requests to decrease the amount of data transmitted to clients. Useful for most Node.js applications to improve performance.

cookie-parser: Middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request object. Useful for applications handling cookies, which is common but not necessary for all Node.js applications.

cors: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js applications, allowing resources to be requested from another domain. Essential for applications with front-end clients on different domains.

cron: Library for scheduling jobs to run at specific times or intervals. Useful for applications needing scheduled tasks, such as cleanup scripts or data processing jobs.

helmet: Middleware that helps secure Node.js applications by setting various HTTP headers. Highly recommended for most Node.js applications to enhance security.

joi: Schema description and data validation library for JavaScript. Useful for applications that require robust input validation, which is common in most back-end applications.

lodash: A utility library offering many useful functions for common programming tasks. Useful for most Node.js applications to simplify and enhance JavaScript development.

morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. Useful for logging request details, which is beneficial for most applications, especially during development and debugging.

nodemon: Utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. Very useful for development environments but not needed in production.

ulid: Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier, a unique ID generator. Useful for applications that need to generate unique IDs, but not necessary for all applications.

winston: Versatile logging library for Node.js. Useful for most applications needing detailed logging beyond simple console outputs.

http-errors: Library for creating HTTP errors with ease. Useful for applications that need standardized error handling, which is common but not required for all applications.

validator: Library for string validation and sanitization. Useful for most applications requiring robust input validation to ensure data integrity and security.

## Features

- Express for creating server and handling routes.
- Environment variable management using `dotenv`.
- Code linting with ESLint.
- Code formatting with Prettier.
- Basic testing setup with Mocha, Chai, and Supertest.
- Structured project directories.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or higher)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-backend-template.git
    cd nodejs-backend-template
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Server

1. **Start the server in development mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Start the server in production mode:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the values as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
