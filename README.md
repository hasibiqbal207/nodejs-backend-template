## Features

- Express for creating server and handling routes.
- Environment variable management using `dotenv`.
- Code linting with ESLint.
- Code formatting with Prettier.
- Structured project directories.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or higher)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hasibiqbal207/nodejs-backend-template.git
    cd nodejs-backend-template
    ```

2. **What to do before using this boilerplate**

- From the ''nodejs-backend-template'' folder, run the following commands to remove all the '.git' files:

    ```bash
    # From Linux based OS | using Terminal
    find . -name ".git*" -exec rm -rf {} +

    # From Windows based OS | using PowerShell
    Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -Filter ".git*" | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse
    ```

- Rename the Folder name from 'nodejs-backend-template' to 'project-name' **or** <br /> Copy all the
    files in the 'project-name' folder.
    
- The 'project-name' folder should be tracked with Git. If it's tracked then only add a .gitignore file and add the following lines to .gitignore file:
 
    ```bash
    node_modules/
    .env*
    ```   

- If it's not tracked, run the following command to add it to Git: 

    ```bash
    git init

    # Add a .gitignore file to ignore all the files in the 'project-name' folder. Add the following lines to .gitignore file:
    node_modules/
    .env*

    # Save the changes and then commit the changes:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

- Change the following attributes in 'package.json' file:
    ```bash
    "name": "Change to project-name",
    "description": "Change to any description",
    "author": "Change to your name",
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    If you are installing in Production environment, run the following command instead of the above command:
    ```bash
    npm install --production
    ```

## Running the Server

1. **Start the server in development mode:**

    ```bash
    # Start the server with nodemon
    npm run dev

    # Start the server with node
    npm run start:dev
    ```

2. **Start the server in testing mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run start:test
    ```

3. **Start the server in production mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run start:prod
    ```
    
4. **Start the server in staging mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run start:staging
    ```
    
## Environment Variables

This repository contains separate configurations for development, testing, staging, and production. It is advisable to use different environment variables for different environments. 

## Testing


## Linting and Formatting
This repository contains a linter **[ESLint]** and a formatter **[Prettier]**. The linter and formatter are configured to run on the project.

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run format
    ```

## Preloaded packages or libraries
A small introduction of the preloaded packages or libraries in this repository:

**compression:** Middleware that compresses response bodies for all requests to decrease the amount of data transmitted to clients. Useful for most Node.js applications to improve performance.

**cors:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js applications, allowing resources to be requested from another domain. Essential for applications with front-end clients on different domains.

**Express:** A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.

**dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env in Node.js.

**helmet:** Middleware that helps secure Node.js applications by setting various HTTP headers. Highly recommended for most Node.js applications to enhance security.

**http-errors:** Library for creating HTTP errors with ease. Useful for applications that need standardized error handling, which is common but not required for all applications.

**morgan:** HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. Useful for logging request details, which is beneficial for most applications, especially during development and debugging.

**winston:** Versatile logging library for Node.js. Useful for most applications needing detailed logging beyond simple console outputs.

**nodemon:** Utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. Very useful for development environments but not needed in production.

**ESLint:** A configurable linter tool for identifying and fixing JavaScript (and TypeScript) code quality and style issues.

**Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules.

## Potential packages or libraries
A small introduction of the potential packages or libraries that could be used:

**cron:** Library for scheduling jobs to run at specific times or intervals. Useful for applications needing scheduled tasks, such as cleanup scripts or data processing jobs.

**joi:** Schema description and data validation library for JavaScript. Useful for applications that require robust input validation, which is common in most back-end applications.

**lodash:** A utility library offering many useful functions for common programming tasks. Useful for most Node.js applications to simplify and enhance JavaScript development.

**ulid:** Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier, a unique ID generator. Useful for applications that need to generate unique IDs, but not necessary for all applications.

**validator:** Library for string validation and sanitization. Useful for most applications requiring robust input validation to ensure data integrity and security.

**cookie-parser:** Middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request object. Useful for applications handling cookies, which is common but not necessary for all Node.js applications.
